   * Aggregates data for predefined amount of time. The computed aggregate is emitted after window expires, thereafter a new window starts.

   *    .via(TimeWindow(500.milliseconds, eager = false)(identity[Int])(_ + _))
   * }}}
   * will emit sum of 1s after each 500ms - so you could expect a stream of 5s if timers were ideal
   * If ''eager'' had been true in the following example, you would have observed initial 1 with no delay, followed by stream of sums
   *

   * @param eager if ''true'' emits the very first seed with no delay, otherwise the first element emitted is the result of the first time-window aggregation
   * @param seed provides the initial state when a new window starts
   * @param aggregate produces updated aggregate
   * @tparam A type of incoming element
   * @tparam S type of outgoing (aggregated) element
   * @return flow implementing time-window aggregation
